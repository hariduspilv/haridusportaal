# xJson definition files

## Current directory holds xJson definition files (xJson configuration is necessary for configuring x-road data output)

### xJson definition files are documented here but the actual configuration files themselves are located in content management
#### In order to update the xJson configuration files, it is needed to replace the configuration file's content with definition file's content:
- Definition file: here in this repo
- Configuration file: in content management
1. Find the configuration file you are looking for under content management (/admin/structure/x_json_entity) and open it
2. open a .json (definition) file with the same name (from current repo)
3. Replace the configuration file contents with the .json (definition) file contents
4. Save the configuration file in content management
